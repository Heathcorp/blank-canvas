## Blurb

Lost pixels is a collection of web-based experiments. Think of it as a digital, online gallery.

The only requirements for an experiment to make it onto lost pixels is that it is collaborative and public.

## Requirements (TODO)

1. ~~Home page displaying navigation and the experiments list~~
2. About screen with announcements blog, changelogs, blurbs, links to github etc, contact details
3. Search function on home page
4. Filters and sorting options
5. ~~Experiment viewport info page~~
6. Fullscreen experiment iframe page with navigation back to home
7. https
8. Analytics?
9. Donation links
10. Night mode/themes
11. Filtering for external experiments
12. Submission form for external experiments
13. Mobile support/responsiveness
14.
15. Marketing

### Minimum experiments

1. The Button (with embeddable iframe api)
2.
3. Constellations: A star for every user who views
4. Word map: you input a word, the word's count is incremented in a public dictionary and a word map displayed to users (maybe some stats and graphs and stuff as well)
5.
6. The Canvas (the original lost pixels idea)

### Experiment ideas

1. Anarchy git repo website
2. A Forum: either a forum for the site with simple anon auth, or something else. A site like this kind of needs a forum (if it gets popular)
3.
4. The Canvas but with turing machines

### Third-party experiments?

1. Oroboria?
2.
3.
